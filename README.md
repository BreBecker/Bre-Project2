Scientific Question: Is the adult mus musculus an appropriate model for analyzing the expression of the FTO gene in homo sapiens, based on nucleotide sequence and protein similarity?

Hypothesis: If the FTO nucleotide sequences and protein structure between the mus musculus and homo sapiens is >70% similarity, then mus musculus would be a good model for analyzing the effects of FTO on homo sapiens.

File Explanations:

Project2 (1).html is the first draft of my project 2 in html format.

Project2.ipynb is the first draft of my project 2 in ipynb format.

ALIGN.fasta is a fasta file containing the FTO nucleotide sequences for all 5 organisms. I used this to create a multiple sequence alignment and to create my sequence logo. This was obtained from UniProt. The UniProt Sequence ID's are as follows: 
Human: Q9C0B1.   Mouse: Q8BGW1.   Rat: Q2A121.   Orangutan: Q5R7X0.    Frog: Q68F54

Human (4IE5).pdb is a PDB file containing the human FTO protein structure. The PDB DOI is 10.2210/pdb4IE5/pdb. I used this to take various measurements in order to compare similarity between the Human and Mouse FTO protein.

Mouse.pdb is a PDB file containing the mouse FTO protein structure. The link to this PDB file is alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/Q8BGW1 and I will use this to compare the human and mouse structure.
